			&nbsp; #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • In this riveting novel from
			Danielle Steel, a gifted young woman must grapple with the legacy of
			a troubled childhood in order to pursue her dreams. <br> <br>Antonia
			Adams is the product of a loveless marriage between an aspiring
			actress and an aristocrat. As a child, she is abandoned in the abyss
			that yawns between them, blamed by her mother, ignored by her father,
			and neglected by both. Unprotected and unloved, she learns that the
			only way to feel safe is to hide from the dangers around her, drawing
			as little attention as possible to herself, to be “invisible.” <br>
			<br>In her isolation, books are her refuge and movies her
			escape. A day spent being carried away by an unforgettable film in a
			dark theater is her greatest thrill. Her love of the movies turns
			into a dream to become a screenwriter, and a summer job at a
			Hollywood studio. There, a famous British filmmaker notices her, and
			suddenly she can remain invisible no longer. He wants to put her in a
			movie and make her a star. It is a dazzling opportunity but a
			terrifying one, as it strips her of the camouflage that made her feel
			safe. She is suddenly thrust into the public eye—and even more so
			when they fall in love. <br> <br>She will never let go of
			her true dream of becoming a filmmaker, though, and if she wants to
			make that leap, she will have to expose herself in ways she never has
			before. When tragedy strikes, she must decide whether she will remain
			center stage or become invisible again, where she feels safest. Will
			she face her demons, or run and hide? <br> <br>In this
			extraordinary novel, Danielle Steel tells the story of a woman who
			must decide how high a price she is willing to pay to pursue her
			passion—and whether it is possible to stay true to herself while she
			does.
